        <h2>Chapters 4 - Achieve Your Goals</h2>
        <p>
          In this chapter, Charlie shares that setting and achieving goals is
          crucial to have. He advises Michael that goals give purpose and
          direction. The key is to set both long and short-term goals, while
          regularly reviewing and adjusting them. The chapter highlights that
          the journey toward a goal is just as important as achieving it because
          it fosters personal growth.

        <h2>Chapters 5 - The Proper Use of Time</h2>
        <p>
          Charlie introduces Michael to the sixth pillar, time management, and
          the idea that how one spends their time reflects their priorities. He
          stresses the importance of managing time effectively by focusing on
          controlling your time. He advises against wasting time on trivial
          pursuits and recommends being mindful of how each day is spent, as
          time can't be gained.

        <h2>Chapters 6 - Surround Yourself With the Best People</h2>
        <p>
          Charlie explains to Michael that surrounding oneself with the right
          people is a key factor in success. The people in one's life can either
          lift or bring them down. Therefore, it's crucial to be around
          individuals who encourage growth, challenge them to be better, and
          have a positive influence. Associating with the best people helps
          inspire and push one toward greater achievements.

        <h2>Chapters 7 - Be a Life-Long Learner</h2>
        <p>
          Charlie encourages Michael to be a life-long learner. He explains that
          learning can be both a blessing and a curse. When you learn, you grow,
          but when you don't, you lose. Education doesn't end with formal
          schooling; real learning is a lifelong pursuit. Charlie encourages
          Michael to read books and always strive to expand his mind.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          After reading these different chapters, I started to reflect on my
          life and the choices I made. I do have goals in my personal and
          professional life but they seem very vague and unreachable. So I
          review my objectives and refine them to be specific and clear for
          various aspects of my life. Break them down into manageable steps and
          review them regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I rarely manage my time, and I can see without management there will
          be chaos. And I have wasted my days on unimportant activities. To
          combat this, I create a daily schedule that prioritizes tasks aligned
          with your goals and values and removes distractions
        </p>
        <p>
          I always surrounded myself with those who challenged me and pushed me
          to do my best. But reading Chapter 6, I can see why it is necessary.
          And I will continue to be around positive, growth-oriented individuals
          who support my journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm someone who learns when necessary, meaning I'm willing to learn
          something new when I have to and don't dedicate time actively learning
          new skills. However, I realize that I need to start seeking out new
          experiences rather than waiting for them to come to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          By reflecting on these different areas of my life. I see how I can
          align your life to be a successful one.
