        <h1>Strongest Trait: Resilience</h1>
        <p>
          Resilience is the ability to bounce back from challenges, and it has
          been crucial to my academic journey. When faced with difficult
          assignments or personal setbacks, my resilience strengthens my ability
          to meet deadlines, overcome obstacles, and stay focused on my
          long-term goals.

        <h1>Emotion: Compassion</h1>
        <p>
          Compassion has shaped my interactions with classmates, especially when
          helping others who are struggling with a topic I understand well. I
          enjoy offering support and seeing others succeed.

      <div>
        <h1>Hobby: Gaming</h1>
        <p>
          Gaming has been a passion of mine for years, inspiring me to pursue a
          career in computing. But my love may be too much at times. I sometimes
          get lost in the virtual worlds, spending hours. While this passion
          fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills, balancing it with
          school life can be challenging. Still, it's a journey I'm excited to
          navigate.

        <h1>My Hero, Paz Ortega</h1>
        <p>
          Paz Ortega Andrade is a significant character in the Metal Gear Solid
          series, particularly in Peace Walker and Ground Zeroes. On the surface,
          she appears to be a young woman with idealistic views about world peace,
          even her name, "Paz" means "peace" in Spanish. She initially works
          alongside "Big Boss" and his group to pursue peace, but it is later
          revealed that she is an undercover agent with a more complex agenda,
          symbolizing the tangled web of deception and idealism in the quest for
          peace.
        </p>
        <div>
          <p class="quote">
            "In school, I also learned that peace is an unnatural state for human
            society. So to achieve peace, we have to create it ourselves. Crying
            about it won't bring it about, or make it last." Paz Ortega
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my favorite quote from her, it highlights her perspective on
            the harsh reality of peace. That is something that doesn't exists
            naturally in human society, but something that must be fought for,
            created, and maintained through action. The idea that crying or simply
            wishing for peace won't make it a reality reflects her pragmatism and
            understanding of the world's complexities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Paz is someone I look up to because of this duality between her idealism
          and practicality. While she longs for peace, she understands that
          achieving it requires struggle and effort, which is a powerful reminder
          that nothing meaningful comes without hard work. Her character teaches
          us that peace isn't something we can passively wait for, but something
          we have to actively pursue—even if it means facing tough, morally
          complex decisions. Her journey and personal sacrifices make her an
          intriguing figure, and despite her flaws, her ideals about peace and
          perseverance resonate deeply.

    <section id="test">
      <div>
        <h1>Personality Test</h1>
        <p>
          According to this test, I'm identified as a "guardian"—someone who takes
          pride in being dependable, helpful, and hardworking. Guardians are
          described as loyal partners, responsible parents, and stabilizing
          leaders. While I can see some truth in these traits, there's one part
          that doesn't quite resonate with me: being a leader, especially a
          responsible one. That kind of pressure feels overwhelming. However, when
          I reflect on the qualities associated with guardians, I do feel that
          they capture a lot of who I am.
